## <a name="general"></a>General Information 

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.

Our curriculum includes:
* Day 1 morning: Data organization in spreadsheets and data cleaning with OpenRefine
* Day 1 afternoon: Text mining in R
* Day 2 morning: Data analysis and visualization in R
* Day 2 afternoon: The command line for automation

The concepts, skills, and tools we teach are domain-independent, but example problem cases and datasets will be taken from organismal and evolutionary biology, biodiversity science, ecology, and environmental science.

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are required to bring their own laptops. (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance) There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.
