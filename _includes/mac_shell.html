<ol>
<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have 
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set! 
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet 
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install 
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Mac 
should automatically be selected. Click <b>Download Version 4.4.2</b>. You 
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically. 
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>Google Refine</b>
<br>Google Refine (previously OpenRefine) is a tool for data cleaning 
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine. 
You will need to download Google Refine and install it, 
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download 
page</a> 
<li>Click on <i>Mac kit</i> to download the install file

<li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
</ul>

programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>

R for (Mac) OS X</i>
<li>Select the .pkg file for the version of OS X that you have and the file
